# 🧾 Job Listing Web App

This is a **Full-Stack Job Listing Web Application** built with:

- **Frontend**: React (with Vite)
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL / MySQL
- **Web Scraping**: Selenium 
- **UI Design**: Tailwind CSS , ShadCn

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ View all job listings
- ➕ Add new job using a modal form
- ✏️ Edit job data from card/modals
- ❌ Delete job posts
- 🔍 Filter and sort jobs
- 🔗 View job detail
- 📱 Fully responsive UI

---

## 🧠 My Approach

- 🔄 **State Management:** Used **Context API** to manage and propagate job data across components.
- 🧱 **Component Design:** UI is fully modular and follows **reusable** component design (e.g., JobCard, Navbar, FilterSortJob).
- ⚡ **UI Framework:** Used **shadcn/ui** for high-quality, accessible UI components and **lucide-react** for elegant icons.
- 🔌 **API Integration:** All data interactions go through centralized `axios.js` with `.env` base URL config.
- 🧠 **Logic Isolation:** Forms, filters, and state logic are cleanly separated for easy testing and debugging.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Add, edit, delete jobs
- ✅ Filter and sort jobs
- ✅ Centralized API communication with Axios
- ✅ Global state using React Context API
- ✅ Responsive UI
- ✅ `.env` support for managing environment variables
- ✅ CORS and cookie-based session support
- ✅ Error boundaries for better UX
- 🛠️ Ready to integrate Selenium job scraping (optional enhancement)

## 🔗 Libraries and Tools Used

### Frontend (React + Vite)

- `axios` – for API calls
- `react-router-dom` – page routing
- `tailwindcss` – styling
- `shadcn/ui` (Modern UI Components)
- `vite` – fast development server
- `clsx` (optional) – conditional classes
- `dotenv` – for environment variables

### Backend (Flask)

- `Flask` – Python web framework
- `Flask-CORS` – CORS policy handling
- `Flask-SQLAlchemy` – ORM
- `Flask-Migrate` – DB migrations
- `python-dotenv` – to load `.env` variables

---

## 🧠 State Management Approach

- Used **React Context API** (`AppContext.jsx`) to manage:
  - All job data
  - API interactions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Filters & sort state



Error Handling
Used Error Boundaries in React for clean UI even when component crashes.
Backend returns structured JSON errors.

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
